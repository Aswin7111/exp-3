        <h1>Welcome to 3D Printing & Rapid Prototyping</h1>

        <p><b>3D printing</b> is revolutionizing how products are created. From small custom tools to entire houses,
          this technology allows you to manufacture parts with incredible precision and speed.</p>

        <p><b>Rapid prototyping</b> allows creators and engineers to design, build, and test ideas faster than ever
          before—reducing development time from weeks to hours. It's a game-changer for startups, education, medical
          fields, and even artists.</p>
